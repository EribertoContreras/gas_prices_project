# gas_prices_project

# Overview:
- Purpose: To identify paterns in gas prices over time to predict future prices.
- Data: The prices that we will be looking at today are the ideal median price over the USA from the year 1995-2021
- Prices vary state by state, specially because of taxing at a state and local level, for that reason I have decided to stick to median prices over the country.

Data Dictionary
- Gasoline: 
    year: 1956 = 1.12 dollars a gallon. 
    year: 2021 = 2.33 dollars a gallon.
- Diesel:
    year: 1956 = 1.10 dollars a gallon.
    year: 2021 = 2.63 dollars a gallon.

Data was collected in the following links:
- [Gasoline & Diesel prices](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mruanova/us-gasoline-and-diesel-retail-prices-19952021)
- [State minimum wage](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lislejoem/us-minimum-wage-by-state-from-1968-to-2017)
- [Federal minimum wage](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brandonconrady/us-minimum-wage-1938-2020)
# Objectives:
- Perform a Time Series Analysis on the Gasoline and Diesel prices.
- Notate and mark down the takeaways from the vizual data.
- Find key patterns that we can used for future predictions.
- Give recomendations that can benefit both consumers and companies that heavily rely on fuel for their energy and travel needs.
- Make all steps reproducable so that future data science teams can conclude equal results.

# Project Summary:
During the process of acquiring fuel, federal wage, and state minimum wage data, I realize that for this specific time series analysis we would only require the prices of gasoline & Diesel prices over the last couple of years. The existing data frame that resulted from acquiring the data can be successfully used for future data science experiments and other types of modeling.

Throuhgout the exploration and visualization process I realize that extreme economic events like the 2008 economic crash played huge factors in gas price drops. 
# Conclusion
In conclusion, because of extreme factors like this I was not successful in making a good predictive model that had a huge success rate.

My recommendations for the future would be to collect more data over the next comming years, wait to see if results of the current inflation in our economic state returns a similar result as the last and build a better predictive figure and model.
- The other recommendation that we can explore is to use other modeling and explorartion techniques using relationships that exists in the original csv file to predict the prices.
